Computational biology tools for bench scientists who are new to Python and bash scripting

This repo contains computational biology tools for common tasks in biology research. They are short well-commented scripts primarily focused on enabling the expert bench researcher to prepare, execute, and analyze NGS experiments from start to finish. 

The scripts are run from the command line in Terminal (Mac, PC, Linux). If this is new to you, don't worry. I've written a simple guide (see GETTING_STARTED.txt) that will get you up an running in 30 minutes or less even if you've never used the command line before. All of the scripts are run as follows:

1. Open your prefered command line terminal application.
2. Navigate to the location of the script.
3. At the command line prompt ">" enter the following and press enter:

    > name_of_the_script.py argument_1 argument_2 argument_3 ... argument_n

The "arguments" could be DNA sequences, chromosome coordinates, or some customizable options you want to tell the script to use.

Many of the tools rely on tools that others have created called "dependencies" that will be listed in the script header. If you've already learned how to use pip or conda or you've already read GETTING_STARTED.txt, then you know what this means.

Feel free to use, modify, repurpose, and stitch them together with others to make the tools you need!
